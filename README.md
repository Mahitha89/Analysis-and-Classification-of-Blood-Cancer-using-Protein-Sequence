# Analysis-and-Classification-of-Blood-Cancer-using-Protein-Sequence
We aim to predict blood cancer through protein sequence analysis. In this process we get two main things Analysis and Classification.
We're using a tool known as Bio-Python, our investigation focused on discerning specific patterns within genetic data. Our approach involved identifying recurring sequences, referred to as k-mers, and assessing instances where perfect matches were not observed. Through this analysis, we identified the predominant k-mer closely linked to the onset of cancer.
Subsequently, we employed machine learning techniques to train a computer program for predicting blood cancer using the identified crucial genetic feature. The efficacy of our model was assessed through rigorous testing with novel datasets. This integrative approach merges the realms of biology and computer science, enabling the identification of potential genetic markers for cancer and the development of a computer model capable of predicting blood cancer based on these discerned genetic patterns.
